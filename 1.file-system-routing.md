### Overvuew
Add routing with react-router-dom in reactjs
But in Nextjs, we use File-system routing 
- When a file is added to the pages directory it's automatically available as a route
- each file in pages directory is a page

There are three kind of index
- index router
- nested routes: nested folder in page: folder pages 
- dynamic routes: brackets in file name to match parameter dynamically

each routing is a file
-> but depend with product id for page -> we use dynamic routes
[id].js

ex: pages/posts/[postid].tsx

- single parameter: pages/posts/[id].tsx
- multi parameter: pages/categories/[categoryId]/posts/[postId].tsx
- catch all routes: pages/posts/[...slug].tsx
- optional catch all routes: pages/posts/[[...slug]].tsx

** single parameter: 

*** cat all routes
-> pages/posts/[...slug].tsx
=> slug: ['easy', 'front-end']
=> posts/easy/front-end

*** optional (it dung)
-> match also /posts

router math order

-> predefined router
-> dynamic routes
-> catch all routes
